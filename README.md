[Continous Delivery](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/continuous-delivery/)

## Getting started

```json
//TLDR;
pnpm first-time-setup //install pnpm, fusion-framework, vite and build repo
pnpm serve <appname> //run app
pnpm serve:local <appname> //run app pointing to local api
pnpm build //Build monorepo in parallel NBNB: Sometimes fails due to internal package dependencies
pnpm ci:build //Build sequentially
```

Run the following command `npm run first-time-setup`
To run an app run the following command `pnpm serve <appname>`

## Deployment

[Deploy PR to test env](https://github.com/equinor/cc-components/actions/workflows/manual-deploy.yml)

`PROD -> Automatically when merging to main`

[Manual prod deployment](https://github.com/equinor/cc-components/actions/workflows/manual-deploy-prod.yml)

## Creating a new Fusion app

1. Run the following [action](https://github.com/equinor/cc-components/actions/workflows/create-fusion-app.yml)
2. Create the app locally in CC-components, run the following command `pnpm new:app` or `pnpm new:report`
3. Run this [action](https://github.com/equinor/cc-components/actions/workflows/manual-deploy.yml) to deploy it to test
4. Onboard the app to the project portal [HowTo](https://github.com/equinor/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/project-portal/administration.md)

## Development

[HMR](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/) does not work. To apply changes stop the server and run `pnpm serve <app>`
HMR is disabled due to an error in dependency resolution resulting in massive bundle sizes
